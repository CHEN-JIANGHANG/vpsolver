# Python API

The VPSolver Python API has 3 levels:

* [High-level API](#high-level-api): high level wrapper functions, easy and direct usage;
* [Mid-level API](#mid-level-api): objects that wrap calls to VPSolver executables;
* [Low-level API](#low-level-api): direct calls to VPSolver scripts and executables.

## High-level API

Example:

```python
from pyvpsolver.solvers import vbpsolver

W = (5180, 2)
w = [(1120,1), (1250,1), (520,1), (1066,1), (1000,1), (1150,1)]
b = [9, 5, 91, 18, 11, 64]

# Solve a vector packing instance:
obj, sol = vbpsolver.solve(
    W, w, b, verbose=False, script="vpsolver_glpk.sh"
)
print "obj:", obj
print "sol:", sol
vbpsolver.print_solution(obj, sol)
```

The high level API (`pyvpsolver.solvers`) includes two solvers: `vbpsolver` (for vector packing) and `mvbpsolver` (for multiple-choice vector packing).

## Mid-level API

Example:

```python

from pyvpsolver import VBP, AFG, MPS, LP # from mid-level API
from pyvpsolver.solvers import vbpsolver # from high-level API

# Create a vector packing instance:
instance = VBP(
    [5180], # bin capacity
    [1120, 1250, 520, 1066, 1000, 1150], # item weights
    [9, 5, 91, 18, 11, 64], # item demands
    verbose=False
)

# Create an arc-flow graph for the instance:
afg = AFG(instanceA, verbose=False)

# Create .mps model for the graph:
mps_model = MPS(afg, verbose=False)

# Solve the model an extract the solution:
out, solution = VPSolver.script("vpsolver_glpk.sh", mps_model, afg, verbose=True)

# Print the solution:
obj, sol = solution
vbpsolver.print_solution(obj, sol)
```
