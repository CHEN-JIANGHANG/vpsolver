# VPSolver

VPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation with graph compression [[Poster][poster]]. VPSolver generates very strong models (equivalent to Gilmore and Gomory's) that can be solved using general-purpose mixed-integer programming solvers such as Gurobi and GLPK [[Paper][paper]].
