Arc-flow Vector Packing Solver (VPSolver)

--
VPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation with graph 
compression. VPSolver can generate .mps and .lp files that can be solved using 
general-purpose mixed-integer programming solvers such as Gurobi and GLPK. 

For more details, please refer to the manual.
