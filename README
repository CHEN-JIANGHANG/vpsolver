VPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation with graph 
compression.  VPSolver generates very strong models (equivalent to Gilmore and 
Gomory's) that can be solved using general-purpose mixed-integer programming 
solvers such as Gurobi and GLPK. VPSolver does not explicitly require any MIP 
solver in particular, though a good  MIP solver may be necessary for solving 
large models.

For more details, please refer to the manual.
